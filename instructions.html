    <p>This tutorial builds on the code from
      <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib1')</script> and
      <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib2')</script>, by implementing the Fibonacci
      program in a way that is somewhat faster, but still fully recursive. By
      removing many of the redundant instructions from the compiler-generated
      code, this program is intended to clarify the essential ones, and to
      introduce some simple principles of code optimization. To follow the
      commentary, you will want to open the files <a href="../../../util/showPHP.php?filename=../t0/t0.c"
        target="t0">../t0/t0.c</a>, <a href="../../../util/showPHP.php?filename=../t6/t6.s"
        target="t6">../t6/t6.s</a>, and <a href="../../../util/showPHP.php?filename=t7.s"
        target="t7">t7.s</a> so that you can compare these files easily. Some
      lines you should notice in <a href="../../../util/showPHP.php?filename=t7.s"
        target="t7">t7.s</a> are:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>8-11: If we are dealing with the basis case (i &lt;= 1), don't bother
        building a stack frame. Just put the return value into <span class="register">w0</span>
        and return.</p>
      <p>13-16: These lines are similar to lines 8-10 of <a href="../../../util/showPHP.php?filename=../t6/t6.s"
          target="t6">t6.s</a>. We do NOT want to interfere with the essential
        stack frame mechanism. We save a little space on the stack by pushing 32
        bytes rather than 48, because we only have to store two <code>int</code>s
        in addition to the frame pointer and link register.</p>
      <p>18: Because of the way the test was performed in line 8, <span class="register">w0</span>
        already contains the value i - 1, so we are ready to call Fib(i - 1).</p>
      <p>20-23: We save the value of j on the stack, retrieve i-1, then call
        Fib(i - 2). Note that since we saved the value of i&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 on the
        stack, rather than i, we only subtract 1 here.</p>
      <p>25-28: We retrieve j off the stack, add to k (which is in <span class="register">w0</span>
        after the call to Fib(i - 2)), and return. Note that the last two
        instructions are identical to lines 47-48 of <a href="../../../util/showPHP.php?filename=../t6/t6.s"
          target="t6">t6.s</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This program can be understood without resorting to the debugger. Change
      to the t6 directory, make and run t6, and enter progressively larger
      values of N until it takes 5-10 seconds to compute Fib(N). Then change
      back to this directory, make and run t7, and enter the same value of N.
      The improved program should compute the same result in about half the
      time.</p>
    <p><b>Self-Test</b></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>(8) How does the stack frame for this program differ from the one for
        <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib2')</script>? Refer to the stack frame
        for the previous tutorial, and sketch the equivalent stack frame for
        this tutorial. (You should be able to do this without the debugger; but
        it's there if you need it. :-)</li>
      <li>(2) Note that we didn't bother to optimize the main() program. Why
        not?</li>
    </ol>
    <p align="CENTER"></p>
    <p><b>Assignment</b></p>
    <p> Take the disassembled function you created in the previous tutorial, and
      rewrite it, eliminating unnecessary data movements.&nbsp; Copy your main
      program <strong>../t0/t0s</strong><em>x</em><strong>m.cpp</strong> to <strong>t7s</strong><em>x</em><strong>m.cpp</strong>,
      and make sure your improved version compiles, links, and runs. Typically,
      you can expect to reduce the running time of your function without
      affecting the correctness of the algorithm. Submit <strong>t7s</strong><em>x</em><strong>m.cpp</strong>
      and <b>t7s</b><i>x</i><b>.s</b>, using the same letter <i>x</i> that you
      used to submit your program in
      <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib1')</script>. Run your revised program, and
      copy the terminal session into <b>t7s</b><i>x</i><b>.log</b>, and submit
      that as well.</p>
